# Augmented-Reality
This augmented reality application uses OpenCV to overlay an image onto a live webcam feed by detecting keypoints and matching descriptors with the ORB algorithm and FLANN matcher. When enough matches are found, a homography matrix aligns the augmenting image with the input image's keypoints for a seamless overlay
